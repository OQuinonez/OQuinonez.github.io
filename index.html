                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a bilingual hispanic that was
                                    born and raised in Pontotoc, Mississippi. Since when I was young, my parents wanted to
                                    show me the importance of being a hard worker. I began working in Mexican restaurants
                                    at a really young age. Working in restaurants taught me that you have to work for what
                                    you want. Nothing in life is just given to you. After a while, I noticed that I would
                                    not like to work in a restaurant my whole life. I played football, soccer, and track
                                    when I was in highschool. Those sports helped me learn how to work in a team and how
                                    to step up when no one does. On a daily bases I just focus on becoming a better person,
                                    and
                                    <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/" target="_blank">Base Camp Coding Academy</a> has helped me in becoming a better programmer and a better
                                    person.

                                        future. I am different because I just focus on living one day at a time. I give it
                                        all I have everyday like if it was the last. After graduation I hope to get hired
                                        by one of the great companies that are sponsoring Base Camp. I hope to go in as an
                                        entry one developer. I have a lot of work experience, but I have never worked as
                                        a software developer. All I know is that I am going to start at the bottom, and that
                                        I am going to work my way up every day.

                                <!-- <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked in Mexican restaurants
                                    for a long while. At a young age I learned how hard you have to work to get something
                                    simple, like pair of shoes. When I began to work in a restaurant, I began as a dish washer.
                                    As I got older, I noticed that I wanted to work my way up. I was not planning on being
                                    a dish washer as long as I had a part time job. That is when I noticed that I had to
                                    constantly keep learning. It took me a while to learn how to cook the food from the menu
                                    and from the buffet of the restaurant. Once I learned, I got promoted. Learning all of
                                    that was one of the hardest challenges of my life so far. I had to learn over 50 types
                                    of foods, and I still had to learn everything in shcool. After a while I got put as a
                                    bus boy in the restaurant, then, I managed the buffet. Learning all of that was not hard
                                    because of the foundation I had built.
                                </p> -->

                                    and I have also thrown cement floors down. There were not many opportunities to get promoted
                                    in those jobs, because it most of the workers did the same thing. Working from a young
                                    age taught me a lot of things. What I think it mostly did was make me a better person.
                                    It made me want to always work my way up.

                                        year, we started with Python, and then we moved our way towards the frontend as we
                                        learned JavaScript. We later came back to the backend, and we learned Django. The
                                        Django project was a fake instagram. The goal was to make an app where the user can
                                        add a picture, and add filters to them. I added some additional features that allowed
                                        the user to make a comment, and also allowed them to delete a post.</p>

                                        a competition we do in class to show off our skills. Most of the projects we have

                                        and I have done. It is a game the stimulates a helicopter trying to get out of a
                                        cliff. It starts out easy and gets harder as you go on. Once we got the idea, we
                                        copied a snake game, which we modified before. We used a little bit of that application
                                        and added some of our ideas to make the game we wanted.</p>

                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing we did when we started working
                                        with JavaScript is get acostumed to its format by testing functions that were given
                                        to use by our instructors. One of the first applications we modified was a webpage
                                        that would check for a valid username and password. It would also ask the user to
                                        repeat the password to double check that it was correct. The project also required
                                        us to use a lot of Jquery which also helped use get a better understanding of JavaScript.
                                        The application was modified so the button below will show you what I started out
                                        with and the description of the project.

                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After we finished our final Django Project,
                                        we started to learn Java. We started with a simple application in Java, then we started
                                        to rebuild the projects we have done in Python. This project is the most complicated
                                        one we have done so far because we open files to read and write in them. That was
                                        a skill I had learned in Python, but I had to approach it differently in Java.

                                        projects we did was the Gladiator Project. It was a little bit different because
                                        of the new language, but I was able to achieve my goal and made the application.
                                        It helped me get the idea of how the pieces connect in Java, and the tools I have
                                        available.
