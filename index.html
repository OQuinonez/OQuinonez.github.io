        <p>I was born and raised in Pontotoc, Mississippi. Since when I was young, my parents wanted to show me the importance
            of being a hard worker.
            <br />I began working in Mexican restaurants at a really young age. Working in restaurants taught me that you
            have to work for what you want. Nothing in life is just given to you. After a while, I noticed that I would not
            like to work in a restaurant my whole life.
            <br />I played football, soccer, and track when I was in highschool. Those sports helped me learn how to work
            in a team and how to step up when no one does.
            <br />On a daily bases I just focus on becoming a better person, and Base Camp has helped me a lot in many things.
