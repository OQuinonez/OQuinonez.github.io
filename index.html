                        <div class="font">
                            <p> I was born and raised in Pontotoc, Mississippi. Since when I was young, my parents wanted to
                                show me the importance of being a hard worker. I began working in Mexican restaurants at
                                a really young age. Working in restaurants taught me that you have to work for what you want.
                                Nothing in life is just given to you. After a while, I noticed that I would not like to work
                                in a restaurant my whole life. I played football, soccer, and track when I was in highschool.
                                Those sports helped me learn how to work in a team and how to step up when no one does. On
                                a daily bases I just focus on becoming a better person, and Base Camp has helped me a lot
                                in many things.

                                <p>Many people stress out about the future. I am diffferent because I just focus on living one
                                    day at a time. I give it all I have everyday like if it was the last. After graduation
                                    I hope to get hired by one of the great companies that are sponsering Base Camp. I hope
                                    to go in as an entry 1 developer. I have had a lot of experience working, but I have
                                    never worked as a developer. All I know is that I am going to start at the bottom, and
                                    that I am going to work my way up every day.

                        <div class="font">
                            <p>I have worked in Mexican restaurants for a long while. At a young age I learned how hard you
                                have to work to get a new pair of shoes. When I began to work in a restaurant, I began as
                                a dish washer. As I got older, I noticed that I wanted to work my way up. I was not planning
                                on being a dish washer as long as I had a part time job. That is when I noticed that I had
                                to constantly keep learning. It took me a while to learn how to cook the food from the menu
                                and from the buffet of the restaurant. Once I learned, I got promoted. Learning all of that
                                was one of the hardest challenges of my life so far. I had to learn over 50 types of foods,
                                and I still had to learn everything in shcool. After a while I got put as a bus boy in the
                                restaurant, then, I managed the buffet. Managing the buffet was not that hard, because I
                                already new the foods.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also had other temporarily jobs. I put up sheetrock for a while, and I have also thrown cement floors down. There were
                                not many opportunities to get promoted in those jobs, because it mostly workers, and a manager.
                                Working from a young age taught me a lot of things. What I think it mostly did was make me
                                a better person. It made me want to always work my way up.

                <div class="rental_store">
                    <div class="font">
                        <p>I have done many projects while attending Base Camp. When we finished learning the fundamentals of
                            Python, we made a rental store project.<br />

                <h3>Gas Pump Application</h3>
                <div class="gas_pump">
                    <div class="font">
                        <p>In Base Camp, we have worked on many projects, and one of my favorite ones is the gas pump project
                            we did.
                            <br />The application stimulates a gas pump. It was challenging because it was one of the first
                            projects we did.
                            <br /> Despite the challenge, it helped me getting my own style on how I code.

                    <div class="font">
                        <p>Another interesting project we have done in class is the gladiator project. The project stimulates
                            two gladiators fighting. It is a simple project where the user has a couple of choices that he
                            or she can choose from.<br /> It was also the first object oriented programming project we did
                            in class.

                <h3>Hack-A-Thon Project</h3>
                <div class="bad_driver">
                    <div class="font">
                        <p>Before I began, a Hack-A-Thon is a competition we do in class to show off our skills. Most of the
                            projects we have done in class have been done individually. For the competition, a classmate
                            and I got together to make one of the best projects I think my classmate and I have done. It
                            is a game the stimulates a helicopter trying to get out of a cliff. It starts out easy and gets
                            harder as you go on. Once we got the idea, we copied a snake game, which we modified before.
                            We used a little bit of that application and added some of our ideas to make the game we wanted.
