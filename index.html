    <div class="description">
        <p>I was born and raised in Pontotoc, Mississippi. Since when I was young, my parents wanted to show me the importance
            of being a hard worker.
            <br />I began working in Mexican restaurants at a really young age. Working in restaurants taught me that you
            have to work for what you want. Nothing in life is just given to you. After a while, I noticed that I would not
            like to work in a restaurant my whole life.
            <br />I played football, soccer, and track when I was in highschool. Those sports helped me learn how to work
            in a team and how to step up when no one does.
            <br />On a daily bases I just focus on becoming a better person, and Base Camp has helped me a lot in many things.

    <div class="rental_store">
        <p>I have done many projects while attending Base Camp.</p>
        <p>When we finished learning the fundamentals of Python, we made a rental store project.<br />
            <a href="https://github.com/OQuinonez/rental_store_OsvaldoQuinonez" target="_blank">Here is my Python project</a>

    <div class="gas_pump">
        <p>In Base Camp, we have worked on many projects, and one of my favorite ones is the gas pump project we did.<br />The
            application stimulates a gas pump. It was challenging because it was one of the first projects we did.
            <br /> Despite the challenge, it helped me getting my own style on how I code.

    <div class="gladiator">
        <p>Another interesting project we have done in class is the gladiator project. The project stimulates two gladiators
            fighting. It is a simple project where the user has a couple of choices that he or she can choose from.<br />            It was also the first object oriented programming project we did in class. <br />
